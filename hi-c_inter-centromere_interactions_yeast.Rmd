The objective of this notebook is to develop working knowledge of:<br>
1) How to compute P(s) from several samples and compare them<br>
2) How to compute distance-adjusted correlation between Hi-C datasets with `HiCRep`<br>
3) How to perform differential interaction analysis between Hi-C datasets with `multiHiCcompare`
